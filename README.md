Raspberry pi b+ hand held camera

This will be a raspberry pi b+ based portable camera with safe shutdown button, 
camera capture button, and hardware reset button.
It will use the standard RPi camera module
The camera will run on batteries

the camera will run two python scripts at start up from rc.local
TECshutdownpi.py for the safe shutdown button 
StandardCamLoopVersion.py for controls via a capture button and saving the captured file

Future possibilitys include a touch screen with icons to run different capture modes easly and see preview ,
flash, night vision, support for different camera modules, who knows?...
